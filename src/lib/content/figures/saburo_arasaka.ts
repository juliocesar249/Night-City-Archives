  bio: [
    "Saburo Arasaka was the immensely powerful and ancient founder and CEO of the Arasaka Corporation. Born in 1919, he transformed Arasaka from a small manufacturing company into a global superpower in security, banking, and military hardware.",
    "A staunch Japanese imperialist and a veteran of World War II, Saburo was driven by a vision of a strong, Arasaka-led Japan and a world order maintained by corporate power. He was ruthless, intelligent, and lived for over 150 years thanks to advanced medical technology.",
    "His obsession with legacy and control led to the development of the 'Secure Your Soul' program (Soulkiller), aiming for a form of digital immortality. He was murdered by his son Yorinobu in 2077, an event that V witnesses and becomes entangled in."
